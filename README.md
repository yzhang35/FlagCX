## About
[FlagCX](https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagCX.git) is a scalable and adaptive cross-chip communication library developed with the backing of the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence (BAAI).

FlagCX is also a part of [FlagAI-Open](https://flagopen.baai.ac.cn/), an open-source initiative by BAAI that aims to foster an open-source ecosystem for AI technologies. It serves as a platform where developers, researchers, and AI enthusiasts can collaborate on various AI projects, contribute to the development of cutting-edge AI solutions, and share their work with the global community.

FlagCX leverages native collective communications libraries to provide the full support of single-chip communications on different platforms. In addition to its native x-CCL support, FlagCX provides an original device-buffer RDMA design to offer advanced support for cross-chip high-performance sendrecev operations, which can also be integrated with native x-CCL backends to enable optimized cross-chip collective communications. A comprehensive list of currently supported communication backends and their different capabilities are listed as follows:

- [GLOO](https://github.com/facebookincubator/gloo), Gloo Collective Communications Library.
- [MPI](https://www.mpich.org), Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard.

FlagCX also integrates with upper-layer applications such as PyTorch and PaddlePaddle based on its unified APIs. The table below presents all supported frameworks by FlagCX and their related communication operations, where the `batch_XXX` and `XXX_coalesced` ops refer to the usage of group primitives.

In particular, PyTorch support is enabled via the FlagCX Torch Plugin, which provides native integration with the PyTorch distributed backend. This plugin has undergone comprehensive validation across diverse communication backends and hardware platforms, ensuring robust functionality, consistent performance, and compatibility in heterogeneous multi-chip environments, as summarized below:

| FlagCX Backend  | NCCL | IXCCL | CNCL | MCCL | XCCL | DUCCL | HCCL | MUSACCL | RCCL |
| :-------------- | :--- | :---- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :---- | :--- | :------ | :--- |
| PyTorch Support | ✓    | ✓     | ✓    | ✓    | ✓    | ✓     | ✓    | ✓       | ✓    |

To enable heterogeneous cross-chip communication using the PyTorch DDP FlagCX backend, it is recommended to use identical PyTorch versions across all nodes. Mismatched versions may lead to initialization failures during process group setup. Further compatibility and performance tests will be conducted in future releases, and we warmly welcome community contributions to help expand and strengthen the validation matrix.

## Quick Start

### Build 
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagCX.git
    ```

2. Build the library with different flags targeting to different platforms:
    ```sh
    cd FlagCX
    make [USE_NVIDIA/USE_ILUVATAR_COREX/USE_CAMBRICON/USE_GLOO/USE_MPI/USE_METAX/USE_MUSA/USE_KUNLUNXIN/USE_DU/USE_ASCEND/USE_AMD]=1
    ```
    The default install path is set to `build/`, you can manually set `BUILDDIR` to specify the build path. You may also define `DEVICE_HOME` and `CCL_HOME` to indicate the install paths of device runtime and communication libraries.

### Tests
Tests for FlagCX are maintained in `test/perf`.
```sh
cd test/perf
make [USE_NVIDIA/USE_ILUVATAR_COREX/USE_CAMBRICON/USE_METAX/USE_MUSA/USE_KUNLUNXIN/USE_DU/USE_ASCEND]=1
mpirun --allow-run-as-root -np 8 ./test_allreduce -b 128K -e 4G -f 2
```
Note that the default MPI install path is set to `/usr/local/mpi`, you may specify the MPI path with:
```sh
make MPI_HOME=<path to mpi install>
```

All tests support the same set of arguments:

* Sizes to scan
  * `-b <min size in bytes>` minimum size to start with. Default: 1M.
  * `-e <max size in bytes>` maximum size to end at. Default: 1G.
  * `-f <increment factor>` multiplication factor between sizes. Default: 2.
* Performance
  * `-w, <warmup iteration count>` number of warmup iterations (not timed). Default: 5.
  * `-n, <iteration count>` number of iterations. Default: 20.
* Test Operation
  * `-R, <0/1>` enable local buffer registration on send/recv buffers. Default: 0.
  * `-s, <OCT/DEC/HEX>` specify MPI communication split mode. Default: 0
* Utils
  * `-p, <0/1>` print buffer info. Default: 0.
  * `-h` print help message. Default: disabled.

### Training Models
After building and testing FlagCX, you can start training models using upper-layer deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch or PaddlePaddle with FlagCX as communication backend. We provide detailed user guides for both **homogeneous** and **heterogeneous** training across different hardware platforms. Please refer to the docs below:  
- [Training Models with PyTorch and FlagCX](docs/user_guide.md).
- [Training Models with Paddle and FlagCX](docs/paddle/README.md).
